**Tips for Using This Template:**

- Replace `[COMPONENT]`, `[ComponentName]`, `[StoryName]`, etc., with the actual values.
- Keep explanations concise, clear, and focused on developer understanding.
- Use `<ArgTypes/>` for auto-generated prop tables, `<Story />` for live previews, and `<Controls />` for interactive prop editing.
- The `Types` section should only list whatâ€™s really relevant to usage/configuration.
- If a section does not apply (e.g., Accessibility for a purely visual widget), feel free to omit or condense it.
