# Frakton NG - Component Roadmap

## Current Status

Frakton NG has implemented **29 of 36** core components, achieving **81% functional parity** with Material Design.

The design system (tokens, theming, documentation) is **100% complete**.

---

## 🚀 Flagship Components

Frakton NG's primary architectural innovations:

### Overlay System
Unified, signal-based foundation for all floating/modal components with automatic type inference.
- Advanced TypeScript inference from component signal APIs (input, output, model)
- 16 intelligent positioning options with automatic fallbacks
- Reactive data binding — overlays update in real-time with signal changes
- Two-way binding support with model signals
- Component-agnostic design — same components work in overlays, dialogs, or standalone

### Color Picker
Advanced color selection with semantic color intelligence and universal accessibility.
- Interactive HSL, RGB, and HEX format support with real-time conversion
- Semantic color descriptions (e.g., "vibrant blue", "pale yellow-orange") for accessibility
- Color blind support — descriptions help users with color vision deficiencies
- Multilingual with built-in support for EN, PT-BR, ES, FR and extensible locale system
- Alpha channel control with visual feedback

### Table
Modular, type-safe data table with extensible cell system.
- Built-in cells: default, template, tag, avatar, badge, and 15+ pre-built variants
- Custom cell registration with full TypeScript inference — options auto-complete based on component signals
- Actions with callbacks and tooltips
- Pagination, sorting, filtering
- Designed to scale to 10k+ rows

## 🔧 Planned Enhancements

### Table - Architectural Refinement

The Table component is production-ready with core features (pagination, actions, modular cell system) but will undergo significant architectural refinement before v1.0.

**Current State**: Functional and in active use
- Built-in cell types: default, template
- 20+ pre-built specialized cells (tag, avatar, badge, etc)
- Custom cell registration with full type inference
- Actions with icons, tooltips, and callbacks
- Pagination support

**May Change Before v1.0**:
- Internal rendering patterns
- Cell composition API
- State management approach
- Integration with advanced features

**Planned Features**:
- Frozen columns
- Custom header rendering
- Advanced sorting and filtering
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Large dataset optimization (10k+ rows)

**Why**: Ensuring architectural decisions made now can properly support advanced features without breaking changes later.

---

### Multi Date Select
Extended Date Picker with advanced selection:
- **Multi-selection**: Select multiple individual dates
- **Range selection**: Select date intervals
- **Multiple granularities**: Day, month, and year selection modes
- **Side-by-side view**: Configurable number of calendar panels (2+)
- **Synchronized state**: All panels update together

**Timeline**: Post Phase 3

## 📚 Design System

Complete implementation with full documentation:
- **Typography** — Font scales, weights, and line heights
- **Color Palette** — Semantic and utility colors with contrast compliance
- **Spacing System** — Consistent spacing scale (4px base)
- **Theming** — Light and dark mode support with custom overrides
- **Motion** — Easing curves, timing, and transition guidelines
- **Accessibility** — WCAG compliance and inclusive interaction patterns

## Architecture Philosophy

Frakton NG is built on three core innovations:

1. **Overlay System** — Unified foundation for all floating/modal components
2. **Extensible Patterns** — Custom cells, hooks, and composable units
3. **Type Safety** — Full TypeScript inference without sacrificing flexibility

This foundation enables components that are both simple to use and powerful when needed.
