# Frakton-ng Roadmap

## Overview

Frakton-ng is an Angular component library designed with excellence in developer experience (DX) and flexibility using Angular best practices. The library follows a zero-conflict architecture (no reset.css) to enable seamless integration with other UI libraries.

## Current Component Library (21 Components)

### Essential Components
- Button
- Input
- TextArea
- Select
- Autocomplete
- Checkbox
- Toggle Switch
- DatePicker

### Specialized Components
- Color Picker
- Badge Selector

### Feedback Components
- No Results
- Spinner

### Data Display Components
- Table
- Badge
- Calendar (standalone version of DatePicker with highly customizable behavior)
- Icon Gallery (based on Hero Icons, ported to the library)

### Navigation Components
- Calendar Navigator (uses calendar header for date navigation)
- Navigator (primitive component used by Calendar Navigator)
- Side Menu

### Overlay Components
- Drawer
- Tooltip

## Planned Components

The roadmap prioritizes the most commonly used components:

### High Priority
- Multi-select
- Date Range Picker
- Tabs
- Accordion

### Medium Priority
- Breadcrumb
- Chips
- Skeleton Loader

## Architecture Philosophy

### Zero-Conflict Design
- No reset.css to avoid conflicts with existing styles
- Seamless integration with other UI libraries
- Temporary gap-filling capability during component library growth

### Design Token System
- Complete visual control through design tokens
- Maintain visual consistency across different UI libraries
- Flexible theming and customization

### Development Approach
- Focus on fewer components for rapid feedback
- Excellence in DX and flexibility for each component
- Angular best practices implementation
- Highly customizable component behavior

## Goals

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Deliver exceptional components rather than rushing to build many
2. **Developer Experience**: Prioritize ease of use and flexibility
3. **Compatibility**: Enable integration with existing design systems and UI libraries
4. **Consistency**: Maintain visual and behavioral consistency through design tokens
5. **Future-Proof**: Follow Angular's evolution and best practices
